The recommended use of this repository is to clone it to your local computer and pull updates down regularly after lectures.

You can use any Git client that you prefer:
* [Git Command Line](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) ~ Currently my personal favorite.

A GitHub account is not required to clone this repository, I would however recommened signing up for their education pack at: https://education.github.com/pack
